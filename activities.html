          <h3 id="castle">A most splendid stroll in Stoke Newington</h3>
          <p>If you want to have a splendid stroll across Stoke Newington, we reccomend the following:</p>
          <p>A: Arrive at Manor House Station. It is on the Picadilly Line.</p>
          <p>B: From the station, walk to the Woodberry Wetlands. The area has recently been renovated. It will seem as if you're in the countryside, with views of church steeples and the nearby castle, 
            however if you're careul, you'll spot some glimpses of Canary Wharf!</p>
          <p>C: Either take the route the map reccomends, or feel free to go all around both resevoirs and properly
            explore the area. Either way, we reccomend
            you end up by the impressive castle, one of London's hidden gems. Feel free to enter the castle, it's a climbing centre, also there should be a cafe
            inside!
          </p>
          <p>D: From the castle, walk southwards on Green Lanes, and enter Clissold Park. At this point feel free to
            explore - walk around the lakes, or continue on our
            suggested route towards Clissold House.</p>
          <p>E: Don't forget to see the deer!</p>
          <p>F: Exit Clissold Park and enter Church Street. Officially called Stoke Newington Church Street, it truly is
            the hub of the area. Filled with independent shops,
            restaurants, pubs and those oh-so deseriable coffee shops, Church street has it all, including street art by
            Banksy! When you exit the Park you will immediately spot two Churches oppisite each other, both named St. Mary's; the old one is now used by artists and for event hire, 
          and the new church is, well, still a church!</p>
          <p>G: Try to find a bust of Edgar Allen Poe!</p>
          <p>H: If you've visited Highgate or Brompton cemetry, why not visit it's less known sibling - Abney Park Cemetry.
            One of the original Magnificant Seven (seven cemetries built during the Victorian era, including Highgate),
            Abney Park Cemetry is filled with impressive grave sites and famous people (such as Salvation Army founders
            William and Mary Booth). It's also where Amy Winhouse shot her video for 'Back to Black'. Unlike Highgate
            Cemetery, it's free to visit!</p>

          <p>If you're a sports enthusiast, then Stokey has a number of facilities. For example,
            amongst its other collection of animals (though don't confuse it for a zoo; it's only a small collection).
            Clissold Park is popular amongst North Londoners in general, as it has a skate park, a tennis courts and
            basketball courts, so more than just your basic jog! For something more impressive, ou can take a swim in
            the
            Reservoir by the castle - not bad for London ey! You have a number of gyms as well, and a leisure centre.
            Other sports activities
            such as Yoga can be found in the area - look and you will find.</p>

          <h3 id="apcem">Fairs & Festivals</h3>
          <p>Stoke Newington has two main events not to missed: The Stoke Newington Literary Festival, and the Stoke
            Newington Music Festival. As
            the websites for these events are rarely udpated, we reccomend simply Googling them to see if there are any
            updates on the exact dates.
            Although technically not Stoke Newington, Wireless Festival is held in Finsbury Park, on the border of Stoke
            Newington. It's a rap and urban music festival
            held in the first - notable celebrities feature every year. Though not a fair nor festival, Hackney Carnival
            usually takes place around the summer
            time every year, and sometimes is hosted in Ridley Road Market, in nearby Dalston.

          <h3 id="churchstreet">Dining out</h3>
          <p>There are plenty of choices. Plenty. There are too many to go through, however we will reccomend two
            as celebrities frequent there: Britain's best Thai Restaurant, Yum Yum (on the High Street, it's oppisite
            Natwest
            Bank) and Mangal 1 (in nearby Dalston). A bonus reccomendation is the Park View
            Cafe by
            Manor House staiton, a good shout during warmer spells of weather.
            We recommend reading these blogs on where to dine out as they extensively cover many places:

          <p> There are many pubs and bars in Stoke Newington we can recommend. Some are historic, some are modern, and
            some have characters who frequent the establishment. Whatever your poison, Stokey will (probably) have
            somewhere that serves it. Here are a few favourites:

          <h3 id="snhs">Beyond Stoke Newington</h3>
          <p>Stoke Newington neighbors a number of diverse and happening areas. If you're on Stoke Newington high
            street,
            at one end you'll have Dalston, the hyper-gentrified neighborhood is filled with bars, pubs, clubs,
            restaurants,
            shops and whatever ones heart could desire. On the other side you have Stamford Hill, the biggest Orthodox
            Jewish
            neighborhood in Europe. If you're around Clissold Park, a stroll towards Canonbury or Highbury and Islington
            will
            take you through leafy neighbourhoods surrounded by delightful architecture. If you're around Woodberry
            Wetlands,
            you'll be near by Finsbury Park, which on the other end has another hidden gem: the Parkland Walk, which
            allows you
            to stroll on a disused railroad all the way to Highgate and up to Alexander Palace. If you want to stay
            closer by,
            Harringay Green Lanes is another one of those gentrified areas, famous for its countless Turkish/Kurdish
            restaurants.
