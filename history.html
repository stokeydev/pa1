      <h5 class="fw-bold">The Doomsday Book</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Stoke Newington was mentioned in the Doomsday Book of 1086:
         "It had a recorded population of 41 households in 1086, putting 
         it in the largest 20% of settlements recorded in Domesday" 
         <i><a target="_blank" href="https://opendomesday.org/place/TQ3386/stoke-newington/">source</a></i>.
          The Doomsday Book was a survey of Britain ordered by William the Conqurer, who famously invaded Britain
           after the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

      <p class="text-muted">
        One of the most famous rumoured residents of Stoke Newington during the Middle Ages was Queen Elizabeth I. 
        It is rumoured she would stroll along the former grounds  of the Manor House formely located on Church Street, and thus 
        the road <i>Queen Elizabeth Walk</i> is appropriately named.

      <h5 class="fw-bold">Early & Late Modern Period</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Stoke Newington established itself as the home of radicals and reformers. 
        Abolisinists such as James Stephen (who is the great-grandfather of Virginia Woolf) lived and is buried in Stoke Newington. 
        Stephen was instrumental in the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire; as a lawyer, he drafted the Slave Trade 
        Act of 1807, ensuring no loopholes existed and therefore could be exploited. He was assoicated with other abolistionists: 
        His wife, Sarah, was the sister of William Wilberforce - had Wilberforce not aquired the fame and prestige that he did, 
        he would have been buried in Stoke Newington as well, rather than his current resting place: Westminster Abbey. His friends and locals 
        Joseph Woods and Samuel Hoare Jr. were founders of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. Samuel Hoare Jr.'s brother built Clissold House (then named Paradise House).
        Other notable people include the founders of the Salvation Army, William Booth and his wife Catherine, are both buried in Abney Park Cemetery. 
        Famous writers including Edgar Allen Poe and Daniel Defoe lived in Stoke Newington. Stoke Newington is also home to the world's first school bus! Newington Academy for Girls in Stoke Newington
         students needed to commute to the City of London, and thus in 1827, George Shillibeer introduced a school bus to help students with this commute, a world first.

      <h5 class="fw-bold">World Wars</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">
        During WW1, Stoke Newington was the first place in London to ever be struck by an arial bomb:
"On 31 May 1915, a bomb from a German Zeppelin fell on the top floor of 16 Alkham Road in Stoke Newington - 
the first aerial bomb ever dropped on London. The Zeppelin continued to travel southwards over areas of Hackney, 
Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest" <i><a href="https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/stoke-newington-the-dissenting-history-of-a-london-parish/">source</a></i>.
Stoke Newington would fall victim to many aerial bombings over the course of both World Wars.

      <h5 class="fw-bold">Post-War Period</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">
       Stoke Newington rebuilt after the war and continuied it's radical tradition. The international of symbol of peace was designed 
       in Stoke Newington in 1958 by Gerald Holtom for the Direct Action Against Nuclear War (DAC) at their HQ (No. 3 Blackstock Road, then part of the
        Borough of Stoke Newington). The symbol is widely used to this day, although many might not know about its origins in the Campagin for Nuclear Disarmement (CND). 
        If you're a fan of Glam Rock, then you'll be pleased to hear of it's origins in Stoke Newington. Marc Bolan, frontman of T.Rex and pioneer of Glam Rock, who infuenced 
        famous British musicians such as David Bowie and Boy George, was from Stoke Newington. Another famous British musician, Sid Vicious lived in Stoke Newington in his teens, attending the local Clissold Park 
        school (now named Stoke Newington School). It is worth noting the historic Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington was abolished in 1965 and absorbed into Hackney.
